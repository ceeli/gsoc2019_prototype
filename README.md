FreeCAD Testing Prototype (GSoC)
================================

Made for the FEM Workbench Testing GSoC 2019 project. A very much
simplified version of the FreeCAD runtime. Based on that runtime a
prototype of the test framework is developed. This project is also
used to try out things in a simplified environment before implementing
it for the real FreeCAD.
